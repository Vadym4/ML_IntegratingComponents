This Week: * MENTAL - Cyriak does it again * QUESTION - Your stupidest dares * VIDEO - At home with Henry Rollins ------------------------------------------------- ________  ____ __  ___ ____/  _)|_  // /_/ _ |   ""We're looking up    ___/  _ |/_ > Sponsor B3ta <<   Tattoo your brand on our balls with our   'gonad'vertising. You'd be 'nuts' not too. Cock   also available. http://b3ta.com/mailus/ ------------------------------------------------- : WHAT B3TA PEOPLE HAVE BEEN MAKING THIS WEEK   Cyriak, cartoons and shitty    >> Mutated moo <<   We know it's a cliché to look at b3tards'   animation and say they are wrong in the head -   but Cyriak is. He's. Wrong. In. The. Head. http://www.b3ta.com/links/MOO   >> Cartoonist v cartoonist blog <<   B3tard cartoonists extraordinaire Bigeyedeer   and Seemikedraw run a blog where they pick a   random word as a theme then try to outdo each   other's comic efforts. It's good stuff and, as   it links off to their individual sites, should   keep you supplied with wry chuckles for a not   insignificant whiles. http://pencilsatdawn.wordpress.com/   >> 'Polystation 3' review <<   Dr. Ashen returns with another scathing review   of some gaming tat he bought off the market.   It's incredible that games haven't advanced a   jot from the distant days of our childhood, but   the casings have been redesigned to mimic   whatever console is currently hot. Who are they   trying to fool? Have they succeeded?  http://www.b3ta.com/links/PolyStation_3_review ------------------------------------------------- : QUESTION OF THE WEEK   Expensive Mistakes   We wanted to know the most expensive mistake   you've ever made: http://b3ta.com/questions/expensivemistakes/   Chart Cat's wonderful story of a banking   fuck-up that almost caused the Euro to be   devalued and cost the bank in question $100   million in fines is far too long to quote here,   so here's some shorter entries of money down   the plughole:   * DIRTY FUCKING SCUM CUNTS - ""For legal   reasons, and cos I'm still a bit scared, I   can't name anyone involved, but I used to work   for a company making cheat code devices for   consoles. I made stand alone cheat/update   discs. For a new football game this involved   correcting all the team names, player names,   badges, etc. For fun, I substituted 'Dirty   Fucking Scum Cunts' for the team name on one of   the badges. By the time it was flattened to a   low res bitmap it was unreadable. We had a good   laugh about this. The disc sold very well   across Europe until two weeks later. An 8 year   old had zoomed in on it. The boy wasn't sure   what it said, but his Dad had a much better   idea... The press started phoning us asking for   questions. The football club started phoning us   threatening legal action. The product had to be   recalled, re-mastered and re-issued at an   estimated cost of a quarter of a million   pounds. FIFA got involved and were rather   upset, as were a large video games company,   who'd paid a lot of money for exclusive rights   to team names. I was asked to leave (they   insisted really). Fascists."" (The Louce)         * STAMP LIGHTS STAMP LIGHTS FLAMES - ""When I   was about four, my favourite toy was this   walking robot. It stood a tall 10 inches  and   had a light display in its chest. When it was   powered up by some batteries, it would march   forward, stop, then do this light display and   then repeat the process. 'Twas not gifted with   great variety, but it made a lot of noise and   looked cool. One day, the batteries run out:   cool robot becomes quiet plastic statue to the   4 year old. Obviously the 4 year old wants this   resolved, so I bring this to the attention of   my father. This was my expensive mistake. He   has a look around, but can't find any   batteries. So he decided to improvise. He   opened up the battery compartment and connected   a spare CAR BATTERY. STAMP STAMP STAMP LIGHTS   STAMP SMOKE STAMP STAMP LIGHTS STAMP FLAMES   STAMP LIGHTS LIGHTS FLAMES FLAMES FLAMES... Dad   disconnected the car battery. It was too late.   The robot had run straight into a wall and was   burning itself into the skirting, a lump of   disfigured toy with the smell of plastic death   emanating from it. I loved that toy."" (Jeccy)         * MR ZIPPAH DE DOO DAH - ""I used to work for a   software house making bespoke systems for   councils. These were nice little earners,   25-75k/year, so we would work hard at getting   everything *just so* for that all important   first sales pitch in front of the great and the   good of the council. So we are all set up and   ready for a demo. The system is hooked up to a   Barco in glorious Gianto-Vision, very important   so that everyone can read all the words. The   first of the dummy records is called up, and an   audible gasp comes from the audience. It would   appear that our rather unreconstructed   Directory of Marketing has decided to key some   test data into the system, so the first person   in the database is: ""Mr Zippah De Doo Dah, 10   Am Dat Wate'melon Street, Blacksville, Darkie   Town."" He'd been busy because the next few   were, shall we say, similar in tone. Oddly, we   didn't get that contract."" (The Fifth Elephant)   >> This Week's Question <<   We'd like your stupidest dares.  http://b3ta.com/questions/stupiddares/ ------------------------------------------------- : T-SHIRT OF THE WEEK   Swirly Face Man      Celebrating everyone's favourite paedophile,   comes our Swirly Face t-shirt. Ideal for   childrens, new ravers and those not blessed   with the skills to fully understand the   implications of photoshop filters. http://snipurl.com/swirlyfacemantshirt ------------------------------------------------- : SITES IN BRIEF   Stuff we like that wasn't made by our mates   >> Sleeve note reviews <<   We know the record industry doesn't need our   sympathy, but we were recently struck that with   the advent of MP3s and iPods that we hadn't   really noticed any album art in years.  Despite   the world looking the other way, there's still   some fantastic work going on in this area, as   evidenced by this enjoyable blog. http://sleevage.com/wiley-playtime-is-over/   >> The art of sharpening pencils <<   There can a great deal of pleasure to be had   from a minutely-detailed explanation of some   mundane activity. This guy enthusiastically   outlines the various methods and styles of   pencil sharpening - and makes it interesting! http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/the-art-of-sharpening-pencils   >> Wolverhampton ring road tramp <<   ""Being from Wolverhampton"", suggests   fizzyorguk, ""Rob must have been saddened to   hear of the tragic passing of Fred the ring   road tramp, Wolverhampton's only real   celebrity.  How about an Elton John style b3ta   tribute, 'good bye England's tramp...'"" Hmm, we   can't promise you that, but we do suggest that   you re-read this classic B3ta QOTW on local   nutters that was directly inspired by our old   friend, Josef Stawinoga. http://www.b3ta.com/questions/localnutters/     >> Joss Whedon new TV show <<   Small whoops of nervous joy have been heard in   B3ta HQ at the news that Buffy creator Joss   Whedon is returning to his true home,   television, with a new show. Fingers crossed it   won't get cancelled or flop like his last few   projects. http://snipurl.com/pleasebegood   >> Disturbing Halloween costume <<   Most people go to Halloween parties dressed as   a cat, pirate, The Crow or a vampire. The idea   is, you can still look cool and, if so   inclined, pull. Then there are people who go to   extra lengths to express their weird   creativity. Kind of NSFW, this.  http://snipurl.com/dontclickthisnsfw ------------------------------------------------- : THINGS THAT MAKE YOU GO AAHH   There is nothing cute left in the world. It's   all gone black.

So huzzah for that and on with the show.      >> How to hide your stash <<   Ex-policemen explains (at length) how to avoid   getting caught while transporting drugs. It's   interesting stuff, although he has a tendency   to belabour the point. Then again, he is trying   to teach this stuff to stoners... http://snipurl.com/omgzdrugslols   >> At home with Henry Rollins <<   Some good-natured mucking about with a   camcorder at the home of the legendary punk   frontman. Not sure if it's his missus or a PA   behind the camera. That said, he still snaps   into scary pretty easily. The freezer is the   best bit. He's an odd bloke - we want more. http://21361.com/website/COTM/nov07.html   >> Cat cutlery <<   The key phrase here is ""after her children left   home""; this woman trained her cat to eat with   cutlery so that it could dine at the table with   her and her hapless husband. She must have been   quite extraordinarily bored. Anyway, now she   believes that cat would like to be in films and   to meet Tiger Woods. Hmm.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkUdDdY_U-A   >> Indian condom song <<   Jaunty public service commercial that plays   like a sort of Bhangra Teletubbies. Extremely   long, extremely elaborate. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLj_3R0-2g   >> Tourette's add-on <<   Simple Firefox browser addon that will insert   swearwords into any text you try to type. The   appeal, obviously, is to download it onto the   computer of someone who isn't in on it and   watch their bewildered features as a simple   work memo becomes obscene gibberish.  http://www.b3ta.com/links/A_simple_firefox_extension   >> Misheard Bollywood lyrics <<   We've seen an awful lot of those 'misheard   lyric' things on the interwebs, so our   tolerance is pretty high. But we couldn't   restrain a grin at this epic production - it's   a very classy number, combining elaborate   dancing, garbled words and some excellent   comical posing as a bonus. http://snipurl.com/condomstani   >> Saudi Arabian king = Darth Vader? <<   The horseguards band perhaps making a subtle   point about the UK visit of Saudi Arabian   monarch King Abdullah. After the first   half-minute or so the report starts on about   dodgy human rights records and such.   http://snipurl.com/dahdahdadah ------------------------------------------------- : B3TA IMAGE CHALLENGE   Results from the Spoonerisms Challenge   Last week we wanted to you to mess with    the language.

This ""fix"" may cause undefined behaviour or crashes. I suggest you get
your information from opensuse-security-announce instead.
http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2008-02/msg00004.html

It's also not generally considered good form to publicise exploits
before official patches are released. Though in this case it had
already been widely publicised anyway.

Very interesting. What I am trying to figure out is how they got in. The
user they were initially using had a very difficult password with mixed
letters and numbers all chosen at random. I suspect it was via his
windows machine he logs in from. Now that my system has been found, the
bot is showing up in other users. So, I am forcing all to set new
passwords (passwd -e) and warning them that the passwords need to be
difficult. Damned pesky thing.

I see the string EnergyMech in the emech file. Perhaps it is version
2.8.1. 

The program that seems to be hiding the real program, cleverly called
hide, seems to be:

Hide - Process Faker, by Schizoprenic Xnuxer Research (c) 2002

which, in it's help message, uses ./egg as a sample name.

I am a bit surprised that these apps have so much information in them.
But I guess they are not really doing something wrong. It is more that

It's a calendar entry.  You can try to install the Shared Calendars
plugin and import the code into your calendar.  In the future, that
plugin might try to grab attachments like this automatically.

[PownceAPI] Pownce API Login

[PownceAPI] Pownce API Login

HI,

I'm trying out the Pownce API. And I've made a simple app that lets me
send messages to my profile through a html form. Is it possible to
make my app key ""public"" so that anybody can login to my app and post
to their own profile and not just to mine?

Thanks

/John

DO NOT use the postfix uid/gid (89) as the owner of user mailboxes. This
uid should ONLY be used as the owner of the Postfix spool directories.

Use a *different* uid for POP/IMAP service and user mailboxes.
